# **Caret AI**
Caret AI is a powerful & free AI quick access tool that brings state-of-the-art models like Gemini, Deepseek, Qwen, etc. right to your cursorâ€™s edge. This release is just the beginning for CaretAI. I aim to make CaretAI the new comfort-zone for quick AI access in daily tasks on your laptop, desktop, etc. like working with Office apps, Writing Emails, Notes, etc. 

## Features
- **Quick Keycombo Access** : Just select text that you want to query, press shift twice, enter a prompt and the result will be copied to your clipboard!
-  **Theming** - Using a library I built for Pyside6 apps, QCFx2, CaretAI has beautiful appearance features like Windows Blur, Acrylic Effect, Amoled mode, A Solid/Gradient automatically sampled from your wallpaper powered by the ColorEngine QCFX2 has, It all just makes my apps appear beautiful to the eyes with ofcourse! powerful features.
